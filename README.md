# 07_Megaline_PhoneInternetEDA

## About this Project

The hypothetical telecom operator Megaline offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. This project aims to compare plan performance based on a small sample of its clients.

The project demonstrates how to perform data preprocessing and EDA working around a smaller, focused dataset. It also more thoroughly demonstrates scipy's hypothesis testing libraries for theories data scientists may have about various aspects of their dataset.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project relies on scipy 1.14. The project is stable with Python 3.11.
